Data Center Window

This project is a simple Python application that allows you to create, edit, and execute code snippets in a graphical user interface. It provides a window-based interface where you can enter and save code, open existing code files, and run the code with the click of a button.

Features:
- Create, edit, and save code snippets in a text entry field.
- Open existing code files (.data files) for editing or execution.
- Run the entered code and view the output in the console.
- User-friendly interface with separate windows for the welcome message and the data center functionality.
- Supports saving and opening code files in the .data format.

Usage:
1. Launch the application and read the welcome message.
2. Click "OK" to access the data center functionality.
3. Enter your code in the text entry field.
4. Use the "Save" button to save the code to a .data file.
5. Use the "Open" button to open an existing .data file for editing or execution.
6. Click the "Run" button to execute the code and view the output in the console.

This project can be used as a starting point for building more advanced code editors or as a simple tool for quickly testing and executing Python code snippets.

Note: Exercise caution when running code from untrusted sources.
